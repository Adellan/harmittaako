Python training, simple terminal program asking for input, saving it to file and displaying the results with https://github.com/mkaz/termgraph/

Does not check for duplicate dates.
Note: this program assumes that the local file is not empty, so copy 'data.dat' as well.

Versions used: Python 3.8 on Windows, Python 3.4 on Linux. Termgraph needs to be installed separately first. For Python versions <=3.6 https://github.com/asottile/future-fstrings required as well.
